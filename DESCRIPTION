Description: The goal of the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) 
    is to study the molecular changes that occur during and after exercise and ultimately 
    advance the understanding of how physical activity improves and preserves health. This package
    provides convenient access to the multi-tissue, multi-omic data generated by MoTrPAC's
    endurance exercise training study in 6-month-old rats.
