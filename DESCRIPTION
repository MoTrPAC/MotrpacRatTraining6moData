Description: The goal of the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity
    Consortium (MoTrPAC) is to study the molecular changes that occur
    during and after exercise and ultimately advance the understanding of
    how physical activity improves and preserves health. This package
    provides convenient access to the multi-tissue, multi-omic data
    generated by MoTrPAC's endurance exercise training study in
    6-month-old rats.
