Bowtie 2 (v2.3.4.3) used index align reads globin, rRNA, phix sequences order quantify percent reads mapped contaminants spike-ins5. SAMtools (v1.3.1) used compute mapping percentages different chromosomes6. UMIs used accurately quantify PCR duplicates NuGEN’s \"nodup.py\" script (https://github.com/tecangenomics/nudup).
